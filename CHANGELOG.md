### ðŸŽ‰ MILESTONE: Working Transpiler Release

This is the initial **working** release of the standalone Sona Transpiler, successfully extracted and refined from the main Sona project.

#### âœ… Verified Working Features

**Core Transpilation:**

-   âœ… Variable declarations: `let x = 42` â†’ `x = 42`
-   âœ… Constants: `const y = 100` â†’ `y = 100`
-   âœ… Number literals (integers and floats)
-   âœ… Proper Python code generation with runtime imports
-   âœ… Parse performance: 0.0000-0.0020 seconds

**Parser Integration:**

-   âœ… Fixed Lark transformer method signatures to handle list arguments
-   âœ… Resolved AST node constructor issues with line/column parameters
-   âœ… Successful end-to-end transpilation pipeline
